A python name generator for Windows.

This is a python package for name generation. It can generate names from different countries, and can generate both male and female names.
Current namesets: "american", "russian", "spanish", "italian", "german", "french", "swedish", "finnish", "japaneser" (japanese romanized), and "japanese". Will be adding Chinese and Japanese by release 1.0.0. Also will split spanish into mexican, latino, and spanish.
Many of the name sets come from https://github.com/ironarachne/namegen.
